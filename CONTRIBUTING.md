# Contributing to Dun Suite

Contributions are the heart of the open-source community, fostering learning, inspiration, and creativity. Every contribution is highly valued and appreciated.


## House Rules

- If you have a feature idea or noticed a bug, feel free to create a PR or issue.
- Before submitting an issue or PR, please check if it already exists in the [Issues](https://github.com/dunsuite/dunsuite/issues) or [PRs](https://github.com/dunsuite/dunsuite/pulls).
  
## Our Process:
We love new ideas, but to keep things simple and aligned with our vision, all feature requests go through a quick review process.
