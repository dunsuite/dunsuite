        <p>
            Most tools try to do everything. <span class="font-medium text-black">We'd rather do one thing well</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            Dun exists because <span class="font-medium text-black">modern work tools are overloaded.</span> Too many features, too much noise, and no real flow. You end up <span class="font-medium text-black">switching tabs, losing context, and working around</span> the tool instead of with it
        </p>

        <p>
            You might say, “But there's already a tool for that”, Sure. There are tools for tasks, chats. But they don't talk to each other or <span class="font-medium text-black">feel like they belong together</span> 
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="font-medium text-black">Clunky interfaces, sacrificed UX, no local-first access, and plenty of context switching.</span> That's where Dun draws the line
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="font-medium text-black">Each Dun tool is focused.</span> DunTasks, DunChat, DunFiles all designed to do one thing exceptionally well. <span class="font-medium text-black">But the real magic? They flow together!</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="font-medium text-black">A task in DunTasks can be discussed in DunChat. A chat can be referred in a task for context.</span> You always have the full picture without switching tabs
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="font-medium text-black">And yes, there's AI.</span> Not the “write a summary" kind. But the one that actually helps, <span class="font-medium text-black">quick actions, smart suggestions, do the boring stuff</span> like “prepare project report”
        </p>

        <p>
            It speeds you up, not slows you down. So the focus stays where it should: on getting things Dun!
