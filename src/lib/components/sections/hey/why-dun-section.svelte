            Most business tools try to do everything. <span class="font-medium text-black">We focus on doing one thing well</span>
        </li>

            Unlike tools that overwhelm you with complexity,<span class="font-medium text-black">Dun keeps things simple,</span>letting you focus on what matters <span class="font-medium text-black">without distractions </span>

            You might say, “But there's already a tool for that”, Sure. There are tools for tasks, chats. But they don't talk to each other or <span class="font-medium text-black">feel like they belong together</span> 
        </li>

        <li>
            Every tool is <span class="font-medium text-black">open-source and shaped with community</span> feedback
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="font-medium text-black">Each Dun tool is focused.No clutter, no bloat,</span> just calm tools that help you get things done
        </li>

            Built by a team who's tired of context-switching too

           AI where its needed, not as a feature, but as <span class="font-medium text-black">a quiet helper that speeds things up</span>
