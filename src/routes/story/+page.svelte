			There are many productivity tools available. We've tried a lot of them. And you know what?
			They're all not great.
		</p>
		<p>
			A small task shouldn't consume so much of your time. But with all the switching between tasks
			and endless features, that's exactly what happens.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most tools care more about how long you use the app rather than actually helping you complete
			your work.
		</p>
		<p>
			The few tools that attempted to simplify things? Well, they neglected user experience. We grew
			tired of managing complex workflows that didn't actually work.
		</p>
		<p>We hoped for someone to solve this issue. But, spoiler alert: it never happened.</p>
		<p>So, we decided, "Okay, we'll do it ourselves" [Of course, in Thanos' voice]</p>
		<img src="/story/thanos.gif" alt="Thanos" class="w-full" />
		<p>
			And here we are! <a

				class="text-title decoration-wavy underline-offset-4 hover:underline"
				>ThisUX – Design led product studio</a
			> with big dreams, eager to make things simpler, better, and more enjoyable, one tool at a time.
		</p>
		<p>
			And the exciting part is, we can all do it together. We're developing these tools as
			open-source, so that those who faced the same challenges can help improve it for all of us.
		</p>
		<p>Our motto is simple. And always will be.</p>
		<p class="text-black">Open app --> finish the task --> get back to your life!, that's it!</p>
		<p>Come join us—we're just beginning!</p>
